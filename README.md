# Travelling-Salesman
I have solved travelling salesman using genetic algorithm (permutation encoding). 
However, I am just a beginner so it isn't a neat code. 
Also, I have taken things like no. of generations, children produced, chromosomes eliminated 
in a random manner (didn't involve any mathematical optimisation(trial and error)).)
