# Travelling-Salesman
I have solved travelling salesman using genetic algorithm (permutation encoding). 
However, I am just a beginner so it isn't a neat code. 
Also, I have taken things like no. of generations, children produced, chromosomes eliminated 
in a random manner (didn't involve any mathematical optimisation(trial and error)).)

So the flow of code is as follows:- 
1) Generating 100 uniquely located cities (coordinated)
2) Making functions that required for reproduction and evolution of code
3) plotting the results ( average fitness, best fitness, final map) (here i have run it for very less generations(5) hence the final path is not that optimised)
